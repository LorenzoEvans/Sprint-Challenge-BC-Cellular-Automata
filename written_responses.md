1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

> A block is added to the chain, via the proof of work consensus algorithm, where every node in the network is expending time and energy to run a hashing algorithm until a result with specific properties matching the proof are returned. Once a node finds a satisfactory result, it will check it, and broadcast it to the rest of the nodes in the network, which will also check that the value is correct, and then, if all nodes have reached consensus about the value of the block hash, then it will be added to the chain, with this process usually taking place roughly once every ten minutes.

2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

> A miner can mine coins simply by connecting their computer/computational
device to the network, and allowing the device to run, continuously trying the hash algorithm against a previous hash value, to find a desired one, and if found, a coin is mined.

3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

> Given the proper application setup/interface, Conway's GoL can be used to observe the effect of some stimuli on a system of interconnected components, perhaps the health of a network of decentralized computers, where the stimuli is a bad transaction or malicious code from a bad actor seeking to travel through the network.
